    <h1>Are underwater servers the future?</h1>

       "Here is a quote from an article from Microsoft"
   </p>
   <blockquote cite="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/project-natick-underwater-datacenter"/>
    "More than half the worldâ€™s population lives within 120 miles of the coast. By putting datacenters underwater near coastal cities, data would have a short distance to travel, leading to fast and smooth web surfing, video streaming and game playing...The retrieval launched the final phase of a years-long effort that proved the concept of underwater datacenters is feasible, as well as logistically, environmentally and economically practical."
