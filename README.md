HTML and CSS Projects with The Tech Academy.


Simple website:
I created a simple website to get the hang of using HTML. A slight amount of CSS was incorporated in that project as well. That project folder is called html_website_project.

Debugging: 
I was given a small piece of HTML code and was tested on debugging it. It was great practice on debugging code and interactive problem solving.

JavaScript:
I wrote basic JS code, including hello-world and linking to html documents. 

Movie Theater Website:
I observed html and css styling from instructors at the tech academy and created a website that mimics a site for a movie theater.

Nonna's Pizza:
I created a website in place of the space station website that is based on my previous employer.

Final Project:
I created and tweaked a professional portfolio that highlights my projects and strengths. I will continue to update it in the future. I hosted in with Azure, and bought a custom domain name, www.eamonnprunty.dev
